  --As we told you in the Introducction of this tutorial, LUA is a imperative language and dinamically typed so we do our a first program
  --  the clasics Hello World.

phrase1="Hello World!!!!"

  --How you can see, we don't declared type of the variable eighter put ";" but it works.
  
phrase2="I'm programming";

  --Wait it, you talk was that without put the ";" it works why you put  it now.
  --Simple LUA works it with or without ";".
  
phrase3=" in 'LUA'"
print(phrase1 .. "\n" .. phrase2 .. phrase3)


  


--Why you put ".."?, Simple, in LUA the concatenation is represented by this symbol, this because LUA is a dinamically typed, i.e. 
  --  phrase1 can be an int and use the "+" LUA will interpret how an add.
