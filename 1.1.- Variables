#Variables
In LUA the variables is divided in two local variales and global variables,
  both can be a combination of characters while don't begin with a digit.
Other LUA's feature is that the compiler can distinguish between lowercase and uppercase,
  for example the variable x is diferent to the variable X;
  like in the language C exist reserved words,
  in LUA also exist reserved words, wich we see and talk about.
Exist diferents conventios abot the declaration of the variables, a of this conventions is that the global variables must begin by "_"
  followed by the name of the variable in uppercase, while the local variables not, but is necessary say that the local variables
  beginning ever with the reserved word "local".
LUA is a language dinamically typed(that is, can take any type at some time that is assigned)
